            Mowing, trimming and clean up services are available
            in a variety of packages. Our lawns are mowed at a
            3" height, which is optimal length for KY
            Tall Fescue grass, to provide the best defense against Central
            KYâ€™s droughts. Commercial equipment is used to complete
            your maintenance expertly and efficiently.

            Install mulch in your beds to give your space that clean, polished
            look that will turn every head.  A weed prevention application is
            also recommended to
            accompany any spring, summer or fall mulch installation to
            continually
            keep your yard looking its best.

            Clear your garden and property of all debris (leaves, sticks,
            weeds) to
            prevent a cluttered look.  Removing the dregs of
            seasons past will give you the clean canvas you need to showcase
            existing decor and incorporate any new ideas.
