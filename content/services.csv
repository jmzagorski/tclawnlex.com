Lawn Maintenance, "Mowing, trimming and clean up services are available in a variety of packages. Our lawns are mowed at a 3""" height, which is optimal length for KY Tall Fescue grass, to provide the best defense against Central KYâ€™s droughts. Commercial equipment is used to complete your maintenance expertly and efficiently."
Mulch Installation, "Install mulch in your beds to give your space that clean, polished look that will turn every head.  A weed prevention application is also recommended to accompany any spring, summer or fall mulch installation to continually keep your yard looking its best."
Spring/Fall Cleanups, "Clear your garden and property of all debris (leaves, sticks, weeds) to prevent a cluttered look.  Removing the dregs of seasons past will give you the clean canvas you need to showcase existing decor and incorporate any new ideas."
Shrub Trimming, "Tame and maintain unruly shrubs to preserve a tidy, refined look. We offer one time rates or a yearly maintenance package, including three trimmings over the course of the growing season, for those invested in a beautiful display year round."
Weed Prevention, "Weed maintenance packages are available to anyone who is tired of pulling pesky weeds, only to have them reappear a few days later.  A removal every two weeks with this option ensures that your garden beds remain pristine."
