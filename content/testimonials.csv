Michael P.,"May 14, 2014","Chris did an amazing job on my yard for a very reasonable price. The mowing and tree trimming was done quickly and professionally and he cleaned up all of the mess when it was over. I will definitely be contacting him again when I need yard work and recommending him to anyone I know who is in need of his services."
Lin P.,"May 30, 2014","Chris contacted me via email and came out the same day. We discussed what Iâ€™d like done and he made some suggestions. While he was there he went ahead and mowed/edged yard (which I appreciated). Said he would email estimate that evening (which he did) and he completed the job in two days including trimming of shrubs/bushes and bushes that had almost become trees! He was very pleasant, through and made sure areas were clean before leaving. I hired him to continue mowing and there may be other jobs around yard in future. I would highly recommend you hire Chris."
