              <p>
                Chris did an amazing job on my yard for a very reasonable price. The
                mowing and tree trimming was done quickly and professionally and he
                cleaned up all of the mess when it was over. I will definitely be
                contacting him again when I need yard work and recommending him to
                anyone I know who is in need of his services.

                Chris contacted me via email and came out the same day. We discussed what Iâ€™d
                like done and he made some suggestions. While he was there he went ahead and
                mowed/edged yard (which I appreciated). Said he would email estimate that
                evening (which he did) and he completed the job in two days including trimming
                of shrubs/bushes and bushes that had almost become trees! He was very pleasant,
                through and made sure areas were clean before leaving. I hired him to continue
                mowing and there may be other jobs around yard in future. I would highly
                recommend you hire Chris.
