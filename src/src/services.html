            Mowing, trimming and clean up services are available
            in a variety of packages. Our lawns are mowed at a
            3" height, which is optimal length for KY
            Tall Fescue grass, to provide the best defense against Central
            KY’s droughts. Commercial equipment is used to complete
            your maintenance expertly and efficiently.

          <p>
            Install mulch in your beds to give your space that clean, polished
            look that will turn every head.  A weed prevention application is
            also recommended to
            accompany any spring, summer or fall mulch installation to
            continually
            keep your yard looking its best.

          <p>
            Clear your garden and property of all debris (leaves, sticks,
            weeds) to
            prevent a cluttered look.  Removing the dregs of
            seasons past will give you the clean canvas you need to showcase
            existing decor and incorporate any new ideas.
